These can be used within an OBS Browser Source.</li>\t<li>You can use the auto-mixing Group Scene, the green link, to auto arrange multiple videos for you in OBS.</li>\t<li>You can use this control room to record isolated video or audio streams, but it is an experimental feature still.</li>\t<li>Videos in the Director's room will be of low quality on purpose; to save bandwidth/CPU</li>\t<li>Guest's in the room will see each other's videos at a very limited quality to conserve bandwidth/CPU.</li>\t<li>OBS will see a guest's video in high-quality; the default video bitrate is 2500kbps.</li>\t<br>\tAs guests join, their videos will appear below. You can bring their video streams into OBS as solo-scenes or you can add them to the Group Scene.\t<br>The Group Scene auto-mixes videos that have been added to the group scene.
